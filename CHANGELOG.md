# Changelog

All notable changes to `boardstate-hermes-plugin` are documented here. This project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 1.5.3

Data builtins no longer render empty in the polling fallback — unbound
`builtin:usage` / `sessions` / `cron` / `instances` / `agent-status` widgets
self-bind at read time.

### Fixed

- **plugin.yaml still declared 1.5.1 at tag v1.5.2** — `hermes plugins list`
  reported 1.5.1 while CHANGELOG/package said 1.5.2. Bumped to 1.5.3 with this
  release so the plugin manifest is authoritative again.
- Template-built boards (and any doc authored without explicit `bindings`) left
  the data-source builtins empty: the "self-bind on the server" promised in
  `templates.ts` existed only as the RPC handlers `registerHermesDataRpc`
  registers — nothing ever attached a binding to the widget, so the view's
  `ensureBindings` skipped it (`primaryBinding() === null` ⇒ no fetch ⇒ empty
  state). Most visible in the Desktop polling fallback (live WS unavailable):
  `builtin:usage` showed $0.00/0 and `builtin:cron` "No scheduled jobs." while
  `usage.status` / `cron.list` answered fine over REST.
- The sidecar now wraps the store for `registerBoardstateRpc`
  (`withDefaultBindings`): `dashboard.workspace.get` (and every other read)
  attaches a default `source:"rpc"` binding (`usage.status`, `sessions.list`,
  `cron.list`, `system-presence`) to unbound data-source widgets — view-only,
  never persisted (mutations write through to the real store; the raw
  workspace.json stays free of injected bindings). Widgets with an explicit
  binding keep it; the browser resolves the defaults exactly like hand-authored
  ones, in both live and polling mode.

## 1.5.2

Gated-mode data path: live Hermes data in OAuth-gated dashboards, and a Desktop page
that degrades to polling instead of a dead banner.

### Added

- In gated/OAuth mode the dashboard REST surface only accepts cookie sessions, so a
  sidecar spawned with the loopback `X-Hermes-Session-Token` got 401 on every data call
  and every data-bound widget rendered an error cell. `_hermes_data_credentials` now
  starts an in-process loopback mini endpoint server (127.0.0.1, ephemeral port, one
  `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` shared secret, constant-time compare, GET-only, read-only
  paths) that resolves the data through the same handlers the dashboard itself serves.
  No external auth surface widens; listener and secret die with the dashboard process.
- The mini server serves exactly the read paths the sidecar's Hermes resolver GETs —
  `/api/analytics/usage`, `/api/sessions`, `/api/status`, `/api/cron` — plus `/healthz`.
  `/api/cron` never existed in Hermes (the sidecar always GETted it and the cron widget
  stayed empty), so the sidecar's cron handler finally gets a bare job list.
- `test/mini_data_endpoints.py` covers the mini server end to end: auth gate
  (missing/wrong token 401, right token 200), response shapes the sidecar maps,
  unknown path 404, idempotent second start, listener closed after shutdown.

### Fixed

- The Desktop page now degrades to polling when the socket acknowledgement times out
  instead of showing a dead "live updates unavailable" state: `dashboard.workspace.get`
  is polled (default 10s, `boardstatePollMs` in localStorage, backoff x2 up to 60s on
  errors, reset on success) and a changed `workspaceVersion` dispatches the same empty
  `boardstate.changed` event the acknowledgement uses. A late acknowledgement cancels
  the poll and restores live mode.
- The mini endpoint tests run their blocking urllib calls through `asyncio.to_thread`
  so the mini server (same loop) can accept while a request is in flight.

## 1.5.1

v1.5.1 follow-ups from the v1.5.0 review ([#20](https://github.com/100yenadmin/boardstate-hermes-plugin/issues/20)).
Item numbers refer to the #20 triage digest.

### Changed

- `@boardstate/lit` is pinned to exactly 0.9.2 (was `^0.9.1`) and the vendored element bundle,
  stylesheet and Desktop bundle are rebuilt from it; the vendored files are byte-identical to
  the npm 0.9.2 package. From lit 0.9.2: markdown headings with an ATX closing sequence
  (`## Roadmap ##`) render without the trailing `#`s, task-list glyph labels are localized,
  the sparkline value label no longer overlaps the line or clips at the right edge, and
  up/down sparklines draw as a line again.
- On an agent-owned sidecar, `boardstate_connector_invoke` runs approved readOnly connector
  tools instead of refusing every call. The upstream gate that `dashboard.connector.read` uses
  decides what is readOnly; a mutating tool still returns "open the Board tab" (409) and is
  never parked or run, and an unknown or ungranted tool is refused (item 10).
- A mutating connector call that times out is reported as parked, but a confirm that lands
  later can still run it. The parked reply and the tool description now tell the agent to
  not retry the call on its own (a retry can run the mutation twice) and to ask the operator
  for the outcome (item 9).

### Fixed

- The build copies the vendored `@boardstate/lit` files before bundling the Desktop page, so
  the first build after a lit bump no longer embeds the previous stylesheet (item 11).
- A sidecar spawn that is cancelled, or whose port-record write fails, terminates and awaits
  the new child, clears the cached state and re-raises, so no untracked second writer is left
  running (item 5).
- Sidecar shutdown waits for every accepted `/tools/invoke`, `/mcp`, `/operator` and `/rpc`
  request until its handler settles, not only native invokes and not only until the response
  closes, so a replacement cannot cut off a connector call or operator confirm mid-flight. The
  30-second fail-safe still bounds it (item 6).
- The abort-shutdown test fails if the invocation responds before the abort (item 7).
- The owner watchdog treats a port record that is not an object (for example literal `null`)
  as inconclusive instead of crashing the sidecar (item 8).
- The Desktop page recovers from "Board unavailable" on the next successful connect, without a
  remount (item 2).

### Security

- The `/ws`, `/mcp` and `/operator` nonce and operator-secret checks use a constant-time
  compare (item 1).
- CI checkouts set `persist-credentials: false` (item 3) and every CI action is pinned to a
  full commit SHA (item 4).

## 1.5.0

### Added

- Unified Hermes package layout with root `plugin.yaml`, native `register(ctx)`,
  root `desktop/plugin.js`, dashboard backend, and an MIT license.
- All 19 `boardstate_*` tools register natively from a committed schema generated from
  the sidecar's own tool definitions. The Streamable HTTP MCP route remains optional.
- Shared agent/dashboard sidecar lifecycle with explicit ownership, dashboard replacement
  of agent-owned processes, and state-preserving handoff.

### Changed

- The Desktop page uses only public SDK members: `ctx.register` with `ROUTES_AREA` and
  `SIDEBAR_NAV_AREA`, `ctx.rest`, `ctx.socket`, `ctx.onDispose`, `ctx.setTimeout` when present
  (with a fallback), and `host.notify`. It no longer reads `window.hermesDesktop` or
  constructs a tokenized WebSocket.
- Node.js is resolved from `HERMES_NODE_BIN`, then Hermes' own Node lookup, then `PATH`.
- State directories are created with mode 0700.
- Live-data widgets return a clear dashboard-unavailable result when the agent starts the
  sidecar before a dashboard is present.
- The build rewrites ajv's `$data` meta-schema identifier (a GitHub raw URL, never fetched) so
  the catalog's self-updater check is not tripped by a false positive; CI replays that check.
- CI validates against pinned Hermes upstream and checks generated tool-schema sync, runs the
  committed sidecar on Node 20 (the minimum), and runs the lifecycle probe on Windows.

### Security

- Windows: the sidecar liveness probe no longer uses `os.kill(pid, 0)`, which CPython
  maps to `TerminateProcess` on Windows; it queries the process handle instead. A
  `windows-latest` CI job exercises the probe against a real child process.
- An agent-owned sidecar no longer receives the operator secret in its environment, so an
  agent with shell access cannot read it back and approve its own pending actions.
- Loopback sidecar traffic (native tools, dashboard proxy routes, the Desktop WebSocket bridge)
  never goes through an `HTTP(S)_PROXY` from the environment, so the nonce and operator secret
  cannot reach a proxy.
- README states the operator gate's limit: it is not a boundary against an agent with
  unrestricted same-user shell access; isolate the agent's terminal (backend or OS user).

### Fixed

- Zombie sidecars (a reaper that never waits, e.g. some container inits) count as exited on
  Linux, so replacement no longer times out.
- Exit cleanup never signals a recorded pid it cannot prove is still the sidecar (our own
  unreaped child, or a nonce-verified identity probe), so pid reuse after a sidecar crash can
  no longer kill an unrelated process.
- The port record is written atomically (temp file + rename); a crash mid-write can no longer
  leave a record that blocks every start. The refusal message names the file.
- The sidecar closes connector clients before exiting, so handoffs do not orphan stdio connectors.
- Dashboard replacement now uses a nonce-authenticated loopback shutdown request, waits up to
  35 seconds for accepted native calls and connector cleanup to drain, and never signals a bare
  recorded pid. Windows therefore gets the same graceful path instead of `TerminateProcess`.
- A successful identity re-probe of the dashboard's own live child preserves its process handle,
  operator secret, and exit-cleanup ownership after a transient first-probe timeout.
- Aborted native-tool HTTP responses settle the active-invocation counter, so authenticated
  shutdown reaches connector cleanup promptly instead of waiting for the 30-second fail-safe.
- The Desktop page no longer installs theme observers after it has unmounted.
- The Desktop page works on Hermes Desktop builds whose plugin SDK has no scoped timers.
- Desktop board inputs (the notes textarea) follow the dark theme instead of rendering white.
- Agent-written notes show their text on a connected board; markdown task lists, headings followed by
  lists, and inline code render correctly (@boardstate/lit 0.9.1).
- Without Node.js, tools return "Boardstate needs Node.js >= 20 on PATH (or set
  HERMES_NODE_BIN)" instead of a bare `FileNotFoundError`. After the plugin files are
  removed mid-session, tools say so instead of suggesting `npm run build`, which only
  applies to a git checkout.
- A sidecar whose owner and adopters were all killed without cleanup (for example
  `SIGKILL`) now shuts itself down within a few seconds instead of running on as an orphan.
- A port record whose pid is alive but serves no sidecar (for example after pid reuse) no
  longer blocks every tool call and dashboard request: after the sidecar drain limit (35 s)
  the stale record is dropped and a fresh sidecar starts. The pid is never signalled.
- README: corrected the security-scanner attributions (per finding and module) and the SDK
  members the Desktop page uses, listed the real widget kinds, and rewrote the install
  instructions (catalog form first, `--ref`/`--force` for the `owner/repo` form,
  `hermes plugins enable`, profiles, uninstall); disclosed that the sidecar inherits the
  Hermes environment.

## 1.4.1

### Security

- WebSocket upgrade gate failed open on Hermes ≥ 2026-09-02
  (`web_server_chat` refactor); now fails closed.

## 1.4.0

### Added

- **Custom widgets mount in Hermes** — the library's sandboxed-widget ladder (games,
  calculators, tools) now works end-to-end in the dashboard and desktop app. Approved
  widget assets are served through a tokenized root-level route (iframes can't carry
  auth headers): per-boot capability token in the path, constant-time compared,
  traversal-jailed, approved-only with uniform 404, sandbox CSP preserved verbatim.
  Proven live: the twenty48 bundle installed, approved, mounted, and played inside
  Hermes.

## 1.3.1

### Fixed

- *Office Ops* template now targets the **real** OfficeCLI MCP contract (one `officecli`
  tool taking a CLI command line) and carries the approvals widget, so request → approve →
  run is self-contained on one board.
- Connector grants **re-register after a workspace replace** (template apply / import) —
  previously a replace silently wiped every grant until the next sidecar boot. Re-registered
  grants come back as *requested* (a replace can never resurrect a grant).

## 1.3.0

### Added — the M5 operational layer

The board can now **connect external MCP tools and act through operator-governed grants** —
the agent reads live external data and takes consequential actions, each one gated.

- **Connector broker.** When the operator authors `boardstate.connectors.json` in the
  state dir, the sidecar wires `@boardstate/broker` — connect / discover / grant lifecycle
  / pending-action engine — onto the single host. Absent config ⇒ byte-identical to before.
  Connector command/url/env are read **only** from that operator file, never the
  agent-writable workspace doc.
- **Operator security gate.** Approve / confirm / deny never travel the browser WS or the
  agent MCP proxy (both stay blocked). They flow through a new
  `POST /api/plugins/boardstate/operator` route — dashboard-session auth **plus** a
  `boardstate.operators.json` admin allowlist (absent ⇒ loopback-only; gated multi-user ⇒
  denied without an allowlist) — which forwards the exact `{method, params}` to a
  nonce-gated sidecar `/operator` endpoint that executes only the four operator verbs
  in-process. Web + desktop approvals UIs call the gated route only.
- **OfficeCLI preset** (detect-or-instruct, no binary bundling) + an "Office Ops" template.

### Security

- Agent-facing connector access is exposed **only** through the `gateCall`-protected RPCs
  (`dashboard.connector.read` / `dashboard.action.invoke`), so a connector that changes its
  tool manifest after a grant re-pends the grant before any call succeeds (anti-rug-pull) —
  the raw broker fast-path is not on the agent surface. Mutating tools always park for
  operator confirm.
- Connector config strings + the sidecar nonce are redacted from every agent-facing MCP
  surface (tool-call errors, tool_search); full detail is logged server-side only.
- Verified by revert-checked regression tests (`secret-redaction`, `rugpull-repend`) and two
  independent adversarial invariant-verification passes.

## 1.2.0

### Changed

- **Per-frontend design skins** (owner feedback: matching the palette isn't matching the
  design system). The board now speaks each host's own design language, not Boardstate's:
  - **Web** (matched to the dashboard's native Kanban tiles): flat translucent cards
    (`--color-card` @ 85%), 0.5rem radius, hairline borders, **no drop shadows**, the
    host page font, "Rules Expanded" display-font titles, sharp-cornered buttons.
  - **Desktop** (matched to the app's macOS language): the app's own `--radius-xl`
    card rounding, subtle single-layer elevation, SF system font, normal-tracking
    600-weight titles, rounded controls.
  - Both are token overrides + a small scoped stylesheet with `var()` fallbacks, so a
    non-Hermes host degrades to the stock Boardstate look. CI: `test/skin-web.mjs` +
    extended desktop bundle checks; feature media refreshed to the new look.

### Fixed

- *Usage & Cost* template: the usage-detail widget overlapped the scheduled-jobs row by
  one grid row (masked by the old heavy shadows, visible in the flat design).

## 1.1.0

### Added

- **Desktop app support.** The board runs in the Hermes desktop app (Electron) as a
  first-class page via a single self-contained `dashboard/desktop/plugin.js` (boardstate
  inlined — the desktop loader only resolves `@hermes/plugin-sdk` / `react*`). It reuses
  the **same backend** as the web tab, reaching it over the desktop bridge
  (`window.hermesDesktop.getConnection()` → `/api/plugins/boardstate/ws`), registers a
  workspace route + sidebar nav, self-styles to the desktop `--ui-*` theme tokens, and
  carries the template picker. OAuth-remote gateways fall back (poll planned).
- CI: desktop bundle structural gate (loader-safe imports, inlined boardstate, contract);
  theme test extended to the desktop token map.

## 1.0.0

The first full release: the board is now something the Hermes agent **builds and operates
live**, styled to the host and bound to real Hermes data.

### Added

- **Agent-built boards.** A networked MCP endpoint on the sidecar (`/api/plugins/boardstate/mcp`,
  StreamableHTTP) assembled against the sidecar's single host, so every `boardstate_*`
  tool call the Hermes agent makes lands on the same host the browser is subscribed to —
  widgets appear live as the agent works.
- **Live Hermes data bindings.** Read-scoped RPC handlers on the sidecar resolve
  `source:"rpc"` bindings (`usage.status` / `usage.cost` / `system-presence` /
  `sessions.list` / `cron.list` / `node.list`) against the Hermes REST surface; the
  dedicated data-source builtins self-bind. Credentials are injected server-side only.
- **Native theme adapter.** `--bs-*` tokens are aliased to Hermes' `--color-*` / `--*-base`
  tokens with a `var()` chain, so the board follows the active palette and auto-follows
  live whole-palette swaps; the light/dark base tracks the host background.
- **Live-bound templates + picker.** *Agent HQ*, *Usage & Cost*, and *Sessions Monitor*,
  applied with one click via the non-operator `dashboard.workspace.replace` RPC.
- **Security gate.** Per-spawn nonce on the sidecar WS and MCP endpoints; operator-only
  methods are blocked over the networked transport; the MCP tool list excludes operator
  approve tools.
- **CI**: build + sidecar smoke + MCP liveness + Hermes-data wire-contract + chat-event
  translator + theme mapping + template validation + Python router shape.

### Fixed

- Live data-bound widgets rendered "This widget hit an error." `<boardstate-view>` resolves
  rpc bindings by calling the binding's method directly as a networked RPC (not via
  `dashboard.data.read`), so the data methods must be registered as RPC handlers. The
  wire-contract test now exercises the real render path (revert-checked delta-sensitive).

## 0.1.0

- Initial plugin: **Board** tab mounting `<boardstate-view>` over a FastAPI WS bridge to a
  spawn-once Node sidecar; Hermes-native welcome board on an empty state dir.
